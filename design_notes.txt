two major classes:

selector - select components subject to rules

selector_rules:
a config file (start with yaml, or maybe raw python. add json next)
a list of "categories" (get the name from open sea): PROPERTIES
within each category, a list of possibilities - and rarities


combiner - combines selected components subject to rules


TODO:

- read config, check against directory - report errors
- use config to generate outputs
- remember, selector outputs is just a list of components
need to define combiner structure

- keep track of uniqueness
- save/dont save - manual review?
- or just save a ton
